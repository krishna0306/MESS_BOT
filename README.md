# MESS_BOT
Welcome to the College Inquiry Chatbot repository! This project features an AI-powered chatbot built with IBM Watson Assistant to provide quick and accurate responses to inquiries related to the VIT Vellore college mess. 

# Bot Queries JSON File
Welcome to the Bot Queries JSON File repository! This JSON file serves as a central repository for storing and managing a collection of prompts and queries for your chatbot. The queries are designed to enhance the bot's conversational capabilities, allowing it to provide meaningful and contextually relevant responses to user inputs.

# Contents:

# bot_queries.json: This JSON file contains a structured list of prompts and corresponding queries that help guide the chatbot's interactions. Each prompt is associated with example user queries, making it easier to simulate and test the bot's responses.
Usage:

# Understanding the Structure: Open the bot_queries.json file to explore the structured format of prompts and queries. Each prompt has an array of associated queries.

# Adding New Prompts: To enhance the bot's conversational scope, add new prompts along with example queries to the JSON file. This helps the bot respond accurately to a wider range of user inputs.

# Testing and Validation: Utilize the prompts and queries as a valuable resource for testing the chatbot's responses during development and quality assurance phases.

# Example:

json
Copy code
{
  "prompts": [
    {
      "prompt": "Greeting",

      ]
    },
    // Add more prompts and queries here
  ]
}
# Customization:

Feel free to extend the JSON file with additional prompts and queries that align with your chatbot's domain and capabilities.
Modify or update existing prompts and queries as your bot's conversation abilities evolve.

Working with VS Code and JSON Files
To manage the prompts, queries, dialog, intents, and entities for your chatbot, you can use a text editor like Visual Studio Code (VS Code). VS Code is a lightweight and versatile code editor that provides a great environment for editing JSON files and managing your project.

Dialog, Intents, and Entities
Dialog, intents, and entities are essential components of a conversational chatbot created using IBM Watson Assistant:

Dialog: The dialog defines the structure of the conversation between the user and the bot. It consists of nodes that represent different steps in the conversation flow. Each node can have conditions, responses, and actions to guide the conversation.

Intents: Intents represent the user's intention or goal behind their input. For example, a user might have the intent to inquire about the menu or ask about mess timings. Defining intents helps the bot understand what the user is asking for.

Entities: Entities are specific pieces of information within user input. In your case, entities could include meal types, days, dietary preferences, etc. Defining entities helps the bot extract relevant information from user queries.

JSON File Structure
The bot_queries.json file in this repository contains a structured list of prompts and queries that correspond to dialog, intents, and entities. Here's a simplified example of how the JSON structure might look:

json
Copy code
{
  "dialog": [
    {
      "node": "greeting",
      "responses": [
        "Hello! How can I assist you today?",
        "Hi there! How can I help?"
      ],
      "conditions": "#greeting"
    },
    // Add more dialog nodes here
  ],
  "intents": [
    {
      "intent": "menu_inquiry",
      "examples": [
        "What's on the menu today?",
        "Tell me about today's menu",
        // Add more examples
      ]
    },
    // Add more intents here
  ],
  "entities": [
    {
      "entity": "meal_type",
      "values": [
        {
          "value": "breakfast",
          "synonyms": ["morning meal", "early meal"]
        },
        // Add more values and synonyms
      ]
    },
    // Add more entities here
  ]
}
Usage and Customization
IBM Watson Assistant: Create an instance of IBM Watson Assistant and import the provided dialog, intents, and entities from the bot_queries.json file. Customize and extend these components according to your chatbot's domain and capabilities.

Visual Studio Code: Open the bot_queries.json file in VS Code or any text editor of your choice. Edit the JSON structure to define your dialog, intents, and entities.

Deployment: Integrate the chatbot with your preferred messaging platform or web interface. Deploy your chatbot and start interacting with it!
