# MESS_BOT
Welcome to the College Inquiry Chatbot repository! This project features an AI-powered chatbot built with IBM Watson Assistant to provide quick and accurate responses to inquiries related to the VIT Vellore college mess. 

# Bot Queries JSON File
Welcome to the Bot Queries JSON File repository! This JSON file serves as a central repository for storing and managing a collection of prompts and queries for your chatbot. The queries are designed to enhance the bot's conversational capabilities, allowing it to provide meaningful and contextually relevant responses to user inputs.

# Contents:

# bot_queries.json: This JSON file contains a structured list of prompts and corresponding queries that help guide the chatbot's interactions. Each prompt is associated with example user queries, making it easier to simulate and test the bot's responses.
Usage:

# Understanding the Structure: Open the bot_queries.json file to explore the structured format of prompts and queries. Each prompt has an array of associated queries.

# Adding New Prompts: To enhance the bot's conversational scope, add new prompts along with example queries to the JSON file. This helps the bot respond accurately to a wider range of user inputs.

# Testing and Validation: Utilize the prompts and queries as a valuable resource for testing the chatbot's responses during development and quality assurance phases.
